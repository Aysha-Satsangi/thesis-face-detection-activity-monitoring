## 📖 Abstract
Online examinations have become increasingly common but face challenges such as impersonation and cheating.  
This thesis proposes a **hybrid monitoring framework** combining:

- **Face Verification** (MTCNN + FaceNet + FAISS) for identity authentication.  
- **Activity Monitoring** (YOLOv8, MediaPipe, OpenCV) for gaze detection, multiple-person detection, and device usage.  
- Achieved **97.8% accuracy** in face verification and **82.4% mAP** in behavioral monitoring.  

The system enhances exam integrity by providing **real-time alerts and logs** without requiring human invigilators.  


## ⚡ Key Contributions
- Real-time **face verification system** using FaceNet + FAISS with 50K+ entries.  
- Activity monitoring with **MediaPipe gaze/mouth tracking** and **YOLOv8 for device detection**.  
- Modular implementation suitable for online examination platforms.  
- Achieved **sub-2ms matching** for face verification and **40–60% emission reduction** in optimized cloud deployment (EcoDeploy integration).
